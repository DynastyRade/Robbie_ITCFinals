    <h1>greece</h1>
    <p>Greece has the longest coastline in Europe and is the southernmost country in Europe. The mainland has rugged mountains, forests, and lakes, but the country is well known for the thousands of islands dotting the blue Aegean Sea to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Ionian Sea to the west.</p>
    <p>Greece has a large variety of landscapes, beautiful towns and unique places, which you will not find anywhere else. Countless beautiful beaches, a network of picturesque islands, snow-capped mountains, forests, waterfalls and mineral springs, spectacular city, a priceless cultural heritage and more. Resorts, azure blue of the Mediterranean, Aegean and Ionian seas, spectacular mountains Meteora, on the island of Chios Mastiha, olive wood at the foot of Delphi, all you have to see.</p>
    <h2>What Is Greece Known For?</h2>
    <p>Greece is known for being one of the most coveted vacation destinations in the world. This fascinating country’s wonders are almost too numerous to count. Start with the country’s endless coastline, which stretches for nearly 8,500 miles across thousands of dreamy islands and magazine-shoot-ready beaches.</p>
    <p>Then, visit the dazzling ancient sites marked by impressive ruins, some that span back more than four millennia of history and reach into the very roots of Western civilization. You can stand in awe of the storied Acropolis in Athens, step into the stadium where the first Olympians competed among the ruins of Olympia, or commune with mythical gods from the island sanctuary of Delos.</p>
    <p>There’s also the Mediterranean-inspired Greek cuisine that’s not only delicious but healthy, too. Not to mention a pulsing nightlife scene that spans the traditional “bouzoukia” to modern DJ-spun nightclubs, all of which cater to Greeks’ passion for music and conviviality.</p>
