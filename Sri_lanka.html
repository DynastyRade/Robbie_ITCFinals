    <h1>Sri-lanka</h1>
    <p>Sri Lanka is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean, just off the southeastern coast of India. Despite its modest size—slightly larger than the state of West Virginia—Sri Lanka has a population of about 20 million people, almost equal to the population of Texas.</p>
    <p>Sri Lanka experiences two monsoon seasons, which affect different parts of the country during different months. This means that, at any given time, travellers can expect a sunny climate somewhere on the island. The southwest monsoon is between May and July, which leaves the north rain-free, and the northeast monsoon is between October and January, which leaves the south ready to be explored.</p>
        <p>Sri Lanka is an archipelagic state, consisting of the main island and a number of small islands, located between the Laccadive Sea in west and the Bay of Bengal in east, about 30 km (19 mi) south east of the southern coast of India.</p>
    <h2>What Is Sri-Lanka Known For?</h2>
    <p>Sri Lanka is famous for its rich biodiversity, large cinnamon and tea exportation, and stunning natural wonders! It’s also known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean and has diverse cultural and religious elements across the nation. </p>
