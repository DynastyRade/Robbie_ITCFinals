    <h2>What Is Italy Known For?</h2>
    <p>Italy is the birthplace of pizza and pasta, and for that, the world owes them greatly! The pizza was invented in Naples back in the 16th century when early explorers brought the tomato back to Europe from Peru. 
        People didn’t quite know what to do with the tomato, but poorer people weren’t so fussy: they simply put it on top of their flatbreads.</p>
    
        <p>Italy is also famous for its high performance sports cars,  and produces some of the finest vehicles in the world. 
        There’s Lamborghini, Ferrari, Pagani and many more supercars. Italy also makes the iconic Vespa scooter, which you’ll spot all across the country.</p>

        <p>At nearly 2,000 years old, the Colosseum is a masterpiece from Ancient Rome. Emperor Vespasian built The Colosseum in around 70 CE and it’s the largest amphitheatre in the world. 
            Rome‘s Colosseum draws millions of visitors per year looking to experience the amphitheatre once home to gruesome gladiator battles.</p>
