    <h1>Portugal</h1>
    <p>Portugal is a country in southern Europe, located on the Iberian Peninsula, bordering Spain. Home to over 10 million people, this country located on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, has its Portuguese culture highly influenced by the inherent geographical advantages. It’s also the European country with the oldest borders.</p>
    <p>Portugal is the best country to live in because of its climate.
        Portugal has a fantastic climate with more than 200 days of sunshine per year and an average maximum temperature of 20 degrees. Ideal for enjoying winter, spring, summer and autumn. If there is snow, or temperatures fall below zero in the major cities, then it makes the national news!</p>
        <p>Portugal is a country in southwestern Europe on the Iberian Peninsula. The Atlantic archipelagos of Azores and Madeira are part of Portugal and occupy strategic locations along western routes to the Strait of Gibraltar. Portugal is bordered by Spain and the Atlantic Ocean. The geography is mountainous north of the Tagus River. The government system is a republic; the chief of state is the president, and the head of government is the prime minister. Portugal has a service-based mixed economy in which the government has privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized areas of the economy. Portugal is a member of the European Union (EU).</p>
    <h2>What Is Portugal Known For?</h2>
    <p>Once the world’s maritime leader and the longest-lived of Europe’s modern empires, Portugal has a complex history to explore alongside dramatic geographic landscapes, turquoise beaches, a rich gastronomy scene, and all the Port and bacalhau (salted cod fish) you can ask for. Trace the various civilizations that have crossed Portugal in the castles, palaces, and narrow cobbled streets typical around the country. But Portugal has some surprises, too – whale watching, natural springs, a village built from boulders, and a chapel made of human skeletons, to name a few of Portugal’s top sites to see.</p>
